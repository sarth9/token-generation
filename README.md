MyToken Smart Contract
A simple smart contract example demonstrating a basic ERC-20 like token implementation in Solidity.

Description
This project showcases a basic smart contract written in Solidity for handling a custom token called MyToken. The contract includes functions to mint and burn tokens while utilizing mappings to manage balances.

Getting Started
Installing
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Ensure you have a Solidity development environment set up. You can use Remix IDE or any other local development setup.

Executing Program
Open the MyToken.sol file in your Solidity development environment.

Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.

Deploy the contract to a local or test Ethereum network.

Interact with the contract functions:

Mint Tokens:

solidity
Copy code
MyToken.mint(0xYourAddress, 100);
Burn Tokens:

solidity
Copy code
MyToken.burn(0xYourAddress, 50);
Help
For common issues, ensure:

You have a proper Solidity development environment.
You are connected to the right Ethereum network.
The address you are interacting with is valid.
If you encounter any issues, refer to the Solidity documentation or reach out to the authors below.

Solidity Code

contract MyToken {

    // Public variables to store the details about the token
    string public tokenName = "MyToken";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "MTK";
    uint256 public totalSupply = 0;

    // Mapping to store the balances of addresses
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Mint function to increase the total supply and the balance of the sender
    function mint(address _address, uint256 _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    // Burn function to decrease the total supply and the balance of the sender
    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
        if(balances[_address]>=_value){
             totalSupply -= _value;
             balances[_address] -= _value;
        }
       
    }
}
